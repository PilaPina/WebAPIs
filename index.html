                            This is a speech synthesizer. It will read this text outloud for you when you press the button above. I wanted it to have a stop and start function on just one button and after many many failed attempts, that included loads of googling, long conversations with chatbots, and a lot of frustration about compile errors, it finally worked. I wanted the 'sound-on' icon to be animated or even attach a function to it so that you could turn the sound on and off by clicking it but I've run out of time. Next time for sure. 
                            Here beside this text is an image carousel which is also a web API. That took some time too and I ran into a lot of concepts that I wasn't quite familiar with. 
                            Also I had issues with the carousel showing one image at a time and was sure that was something in the TS. But no.... it was just a CSS error on my part: totally forgot to set the 'overflow' to 'hidden' on my carousel frame.
