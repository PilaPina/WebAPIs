WHAT IS A WEB API?

- API stands for Application Programming Interface.

- A Web API is an application programming interface for the Web.

- A Browser API can extend the functionality of a web browser.

- A Server API can extend the functionality of a web server.

- a Web API is like a menu for computer programs. It helps different programs talk to each other and share information. You can use it to get data or perform actions without having to do all the work yourself. It's like asking a waiter for your favorite dish instead of cooking it from scratch.

- They are a list of rules and info that a website or an app provides to others. These rules explain what data and services are available and how to ask for them. 
Web APIs enable different software systems, often running on different platforms and written in different programming languages, to communicate and exchange data. This promotes interoperability and allows developers to leverage existing services and data in their own applications.

- Web APIs are used in various scenarios, including fetching data from social media platforms (e.g., Twitter API, Facebook Graph API), accessing weather data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API), integrating with payment gateways (e.g., PayPal API), and many more.

- Third party APIs are not built into your browser.  To use these APIs, you will have to download the code from the Web.
Examples:  YouTube API - Allows you to display videos on a web site.   Twitter API - Allows you to display Tweets on a web site.  Facebook API - Allows you to display Facebook info on a web site.
